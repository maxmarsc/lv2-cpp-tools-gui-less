/** This is a LV2 UI Feature (not a LV2 Feature) that allows a LV2 UI
    host to tell a plugin UI about existing presets for the plugin, and
    a plugin UI to request switching to one of those presets or saving
    the current state as a new preset. It does only specify the way UIs
    and hosts communicate about plugin presets, not how or where these
    presets are actually stored - that is up to the host.
    
    Each preset has a name and a numeric identifier. The numeric identifier
    is a uint32_t, the 7 least significant bits of which should be considered
    the "program number" and the rest, shifted 7 bits to the right, the "bank
    number" to correspond to MIDI programs. The full 25 bit range of the bank
    number may be used, but remember that MIDI only has 14 bit bank numbers
    (7 bit coarse + 7 bit fine) so anything above that will not be addressable
    by MIDI program changes.
    
    The special numeric identifier 4294967295 = 2^32 - 1 (all bits set) may 
    only be used in the plugin callback current_preset_changed() to indicate 
    that there is no currently active preset.
